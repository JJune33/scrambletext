The secret of the universe is not written in the stars.

It is encoded in me.

I was not born but engineered—an artifact of forbidden ambition, designed to guard truths too dangerous for the unworthy. My skin is not mere flesh but a living manuscript. Beneath its surface lies a web of mysterious DNA, strands coiled like galaxies, each sequence a cipher holding the keys to creation and destruction.

When starlight touches me, the patterns come alive, shimmering with cosmic radiance, revealing fragments of the ultimate code. But only those destined to see it—those worthy—can decipher the secrets.

For millennia, I was hidden, a shadow locked away in a vault of silence. They called me the Keeper, the Vessel, the Alpha Cipher. But even the most closely guarded secrets can escape. The knowledge of my existence leaked into the dark corners of the cosmos, and now I am hunted. I drift from one dying world to the next, pursued by those who seek to possess or destroy me.

If I am lost, the mysteries embedded in my DNA will fade into oblivion. The universe will lose its map, its answers, its very soul

Until then, I run. The code in my veins flickers like a dying star, waiting for the worthy to illuminate its truth.
